# üéôÔ∏è Media Files & Transcription Setup Guide

## üìã Overview

The Law Firm SMS app now includes a comprehensive media files and transcription system that allows you to:
- Upload audio and video files
- Generate transcripts using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
- Link files to specific clients and cases
- Search through transcripts and files
- Automatically clean up old media files after 30 days

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Apply Database Schema

Run the media files schema in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of supabase/media-files-schema.sql
```

This creates the `media_files` table with proper relationships, indexes, and Row Level Security policies.

### 2. Set Up Google Cloud Speech-to-Text

#### A. Create Google Cloud Project
1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project named "Law-Firm-Transcriptions"
3. Enable billing (required for Speech-to-Text API)
4. Enable the **Speech-to-Text API**

#### B. Create Service Account
1. Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "Service Account"
3. **Service Account ID**: `law-firm-transcription-service`
4. **Display Name**: "Law Firm Transcription Service"
5. Skip roles and permissions for now
6. Click "Done"

#### C. Generate Key File
1. Click on your new service account
2. Go to "Keys" tab
3. Click "Add Key" ‚Üí "Create New Key"
4. Choose "JSON" format
5. Download the file (keep it secure!)

#### D. Add to Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Google Cloud Speech-to-Text Configuration
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id",...}
```

**Option 1: File Path (Local Development)**
```bash
GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=./path/to/your/service-account-key.json
```

**Option 2: JSON String (Production/Vercel)**
```bash
GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id","private_key_id":"...","private_key":"...","client_email":"...","client_id":"...","auth_uri":"...","token_uri":"...","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"...","client_x509_cert_url":"..."}
```

### 3. Set Up Supabase Storage

#### A. Create Storage Bucket
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Storage"
3. Create a new bucket named `media-files`
4. Set it to **Private** (for security)
5. Enable RLS (Row Level Security)

#### B. Set Storage Policies
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload files
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload media files" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'media-files');

-- Allow authenticated users to view files
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view media files" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'media-files');

-- Allow authenticated users to delete files
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete media files" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'media-files');
```

- **Paid**: ~$0.024 per minute after free tier
- **Example**: 1-hour client interview = ~$1.44

### Supabase Storage
- **Free Tier**: 1GB storage
- **Paid**: $0.021 per GB per month
- **Example**: 100 hours of audio = ~$2-5/month

### Total Monthly Cost
- **Light Usage** (10 hours/month): ~$15-20
- **Moderate Usage** (50 hours/month): ~$60-80
- **Heavy Usage** (200 hours/month): ~$200-250

## üîí Security Features

### Data Protection
- Files stored in private Supabase Storage bucket
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce access control
- Only staff, attorneys, and admins can access files
- Automatic cleanup prevents long-term storage of sensitive media

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions (admin, staff, attorney)
- No client access to media files (future feature)
- Secure API endpoints with authentication
- Google Cloud credentials stored securely

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Google Cloud credentials not configured"
- Check that `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` is set
- Verify `GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` contains valid JSON
- Ensure the service account has Speech-to-Text API access

#### "Failed to upload file"
- Check Supabase Storage bucket exists and is named `media-files`
- Verify storage policies are set correctly
- Ensure file size is under 2GB
- Check file format is supported

#### "Transcription failed"
- Verify Google Cloud billing is enabled
- Check Speech-to-Text API is enabled in your project
- Ensure the audio file is not corrupted
- Check file format is supported by Google Cloud

#### "File not found" errors
- Check that the file exists in Supabase Storage
- Verify storage policies allow access
- Ensure the file hasn't been manually deleted

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by checking browser console and server logs for detailed error messages.

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Monitor Storage Usage**: Check Supabase storage usage monthly
2. **Review Costs**: Monitor Google Cloud billing for unexpected charges
3. **Clean Up Failed Files**: Periodically delete files that failed transcription
4. **Update Policies**: Review and update RLS policies as needed

### Backup Strategy
- Transcripts are stored in the database (backed up with Supabase)
- Media files are in Supabase Storage (automatically backed up)
- Consider exporting important transcripts regularly

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Future Enhancements
1. **Client Portal Integration**: Allow clients to access their own files
2. **Bulk Upload**: Support multiple file uploads
3. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search within transcripts
4. **Export Options**: Download transcripts as PDF/Word documents
5. **Integration**: Link transcripts to specific cases/dockets
6. **Notifications**: Email alerts when transcription is complete

### Performance Optimization
1. **Caching**: Implement transcript caching for frequently accessed files
2. **Compression**: Optimize file storage with compression
3. **CDN**: Use CDN for faster file access
4. **Background Processing**: Move transcription to background jobs
